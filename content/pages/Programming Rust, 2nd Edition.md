[Programming Rust, 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/).

Rust is a language for systems programming.

  + In short, systems programming is resource-constrained programming. It is programming when every byte and every CPU cycle counts.

  + Systems programming is often concerned with pushing the machine to its limits.

Get rid of undefined behaviors

  + The Rust language makes you a simple promise: if your program passes the compiler’s checks, it is free of undefined behavior.

  + Rust’s promise to prevent undefined behavior with minimal impact on performance influences the design of every part of the system, from the standard data structures like vectors and strings to the way Rust programs use third-party libraries.
