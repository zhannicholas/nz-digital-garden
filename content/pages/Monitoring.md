**Monitoring** is the practice of collecting *metrics*, *logs*, *traces*, and so on, aggregating them, and matching them against predefined criteria of system states that we should carefully watch.

Monitoring is a subset of [Observability]({{< ref "/pages/Observability" >}}).

# Blackbox and Whitebox Monitoring

  + **Blackbox monitoring** refers to observing a system from the **outside**. It's useful in being able to identify the *symptoms* of a problem, but not *triggers* that led to the problem.

  + **Whitebox monitoring** refers to techniques of reporting data from **inside** the system.
